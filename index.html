            <br>Hi, I just want you to know that ur so pretty
            <br>Don't look down ur self, okay?

            <br>"Just The Way You Are"
            <br>
            <br> Oh, her eyes, her eyes
            Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
            <br>Her hair, her hair
            Falls perfectly without her tryin'
            <br>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
            Yeah, I know, I know
            <br>
            <br>When I compliment her, she won't believe me
            And it's so, it's so
            <br>Sad to think that she don't see what I see
            But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
            I say
            <br>
            <br>When I see your face
            There's not a thing that I would change
            <br>'Cause you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            <br>And when you smile
            The whole world stops and stares for a while
            <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            Yeah
            <br>
            <br>Her lips, her lips
            I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
            <br>Her laugh, her laugh
            She hates, but I think it's so sexy
            <br>She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
            Oh, you know, you know
            <br>You know I'd never ask you to change
            If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
            <br>So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
            You know I'll say
            <br>When I see your face
            There's not a thing that I would change
            <br>'Cause you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            <br>And when you smile
            The whole world stops and stares for a while
            <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            <br>The way you are
            The way you are
            <br>
            <br>Girl, you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            <br>When I see your face
            There's not a thing that I would change
            <br>'Cause you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            <br>And when you smile
            The whole world stops and stares for a while
            <br>'Cause girl, you're amazing
            Just the way you are
            Yeah
